# 🚀 Big Tech Live Coding Survival Guide

A comprehensive, interactive Streamlit application designed to prepare Data Scientists for Senior/Staff level live coding interviews at top-tier tech companies (FAANG+).

## 🎯 Features

This application simulates the live coding environment with a focus on:

1.  **Python Algorithms**: LeetCode-style patterns (Arrays, Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window) sorted by difficulty.
2.  **Pandas Mastery**: Complex data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation challenges.
3.  **SQL Integration**: Live SQL execution using **DuckDB** (Window functions, CTEs, Joins).
4.  **Machine Learning**: Implementing custom Scikit-learn transformers and metrics (LogLoss, etc.) from scratch.
5.  **A/B Testing & Stats**: Power analysis, sample size calculation, and bootstrapping simulations.
6.  **System Design**: Interactive architecture diagrams for ML systems (Recommendation, Fraud Detection).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Streamlit**: Frontend dashboard.
-   **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation.
-   **DuckDB**: Embedded SQL OLAP database.
-   **Scikit-Learn**: ML pipelines.
-   **Plotly & Scipy**: Visualization and statistics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yandri918/live-coding.git
    cd live-coding
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run Home.py
    ```

## 📚 Interview Rubric

In a live coding session, you are evaluated on:
-   **Communication**: Talk through your thought process.
-   **Speed & Accuracy**: Write bug-free code efficiently.
-   **Verification**: Test edge cases proactively.
